# Illeshian

Illeshian is a procedural, block-structured programming language built around a unique 2-tier function system. It is designed to be easy to learn while offering the speed and power required for modern business applications. What sets Illeshian apart is its intuitive design and tightly integrated toolchain.


A key feature of Illeshian is its new scoping model, which replaces traditional global and local scopes with a new universal scope that works with global and local scope and provides different block scopes for certain data tools, ensuring clarity and precision in code organization. Alongside this, Illeshian introduces a fresh set of data tools and simplified syntax using familiar, easy-to-understand terms. This makes it approachable for new developers while retaining power and flexibility for advanced users.


Illeshian is developed in tandem with its dedicated assembler, the Seedling Assembler, which is optimized specifically for the language. This tight integration enables a one-to-one scope translation, ensuring that the 2-tier function structure compiles quickly and runs with stability and efficiency.


At runtime, the Illeshian Runtime Processor (IRP) handles all file dependencies automatically. This removes the need for traditional header declarations across source files, simplifying the development process and reducing boilerplate code.


In short, Illeshian focuses on clarity, speed, and simplicityâ€”achieving a balance between accessibility and performance by redefining how language structure and tooling work together.
