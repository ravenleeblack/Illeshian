# Illeshian

Illeshain is a procedural language with a block structure designed to have a 2 tier function system. Illeshian was also designed to be an easy language to learn while still maintaining a fast and powerful presence to handle business. Illeshian introduces a new scoping system and some new kinds of tools. What makes Illeshian unique is that the Seedling Assembler is being designed specifically for Illeshian so that it has a one to one scope conversion to help make sure the 2 tier function becomes very fast and stable. The irp or Illeshian runtime processor takes in all the required files so that Illeshian source code does not require you to declare headers throughout all your source code.

In order to make the language easy to learn, I renamed many keywords and/or parts to synonyms, in order to make things easier to understand. Basically if I could make it into lamens terms then I did.
